1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
  Dollar($) is used to give instruction how the cell reference is to be taken. $ is used for absolute reference. For example,
  $A$1 - means the reference cell will remain column A and row 1 for all the reference.

2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
  In order to change the reference from relative to absolute we just have to add $ before the absolute cell, so it will become
  absolute reference. For E.g., $A$1 * $B$1, so here all the cell where the formula is dragged same value will be reflecting.
  For mixed reference, the $ is to be added for which cell is to be static. For E.g., $A$1*B1, here for all the cell A2 will be 
  one value and the other value will change in B column like B1, B2, B3.

3. Explain the order of operations in excel?
  Order of operation as follows - Parentheses> Exponents> Multiplication and Division> Addition and Subtraction

4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax
for any of two?
  There are lot of useful functions in excel. Top 5 would be Vlookup, Sum, Count, Remove duplicates and IF.
  Syntax for Vlookup would be = vlookup(lookup value, range where the lookup value, lookup column, exact or approx match)
  Syntax for IF function is = IF(condition, value if true, value if false)

5. When would you use the subtotal function?
   It is used when subtotals are to be ignored in the spreadsheet when we are calculating grand total. We can also use when 
    we need to ignore any numbers that have been hidden, dynamically summarize data, and sum filtered values.

6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
  Syntax for Vlookup would be = vlookup(lookup value, range where the lookup value, lookup column, exact or approx match)
   where 
    lookup value - which value that need to be looked up
    range where the lookup value - range of cells where the value is present
    lookup column - column number in the range that contains the return value
    exact or approx match - want exact match or approx match , where default will be approx match
