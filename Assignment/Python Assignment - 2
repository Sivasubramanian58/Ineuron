1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
  Boolean has two values - true and false. We write them with bool(condition to evaluate).

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
    And, or and not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
  values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
   A and B      A or B
   Then C       Then C

A  B  C       A  B  C       
1  0  0       1  0  1
1  1  1       0  1  1
0  1  0       0  0  0
0  0  0       1  1  1

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)    ---- False
not (5 > 4) ----- False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) ---- True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) ---- False
(True and True) and (True == False) ---- False
(not False) or (not True)   ---- True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
   ==, >,<,>=,<=,!=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
   = is a asssignment operator, == is comparison operator
  A = A + 1  --- This will result in adding one more to A
  5 == 4  ---- It will give you output as false

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')


Correct code should be 
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
   print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
   print('bacon')
else:
   print('ham')
   print(spam)
   print(spam)

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input("Enter spam number")) 
if spam == 1:
   print('Hello')
if spam == 2:
   print('Howdy')
else:
   print('Greetings')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
  Ctrl + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
  Break:A break statement in Python alters the flow of a loop by terminating it once a specified condition is met.
  Continue: The continue statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration only.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
  range(10) - It will give values till 9 starting from 0
  range(0,10) - here the start is given even though it starts with 0
  range(0,10,1) - here along with start value, they have given difference between next values which by default is 1.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
  for i in range(0,11,1):
  print(i)

  i = 1
while i < 11:
  print(i)
  i += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
   Code
